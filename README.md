❤️ Heart Attack Prediction using Machine Learning

A Machine Learning project to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on medical parameters.

📌 Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early detection can save lives by enabling quick medical action.
This project uses machine learning classification models to predict the risk of a heart attack based on various health indicators.

The goal of this project is to:

Analyze patient medical data

Build predictive models

Evaluate performance

Provide actionable insights from the data

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains medical attributes commonly used in cardiovascular analysis:

Feature	Description
age	Age of the patient
sex	Gender (1 = male, 0 = female)
cp	Chest pain type
trtbps	Resting blood pressure
chol	Cholesterol level
fbs	Fasting blood sugar
restecg	Resting electrocardiographic results
thalachh	Maximum heart rate achieved
exng	Exercise-induced angina
oldpeak	ST depression induced by exercise
slp	Slope of peak exercise ST segment
caa	Number of major vessels colored
thall	Thalassemia
output	Target variable (1 = high risk, 0 = low risk)
