❤️ Heart Attack Prediction Using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a heart attack using patient medical data. The goal is to analyze key health indicators, understand risk patterns, and build a reliable classification model that can assist early medical diagnosis. The project covers the full ML workflow—from data cleaning and EDA to model training, evaluation, and comparison.

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains cardiovascular-related medical attributes commonly used in clinical diagnosis:

Age, Sex

Chest Pain Type (cp)

Resting Blood Pressure (trtbps)

Cholesterol (chol)

Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)

Resting ECG (restecg)

Maximum Heart Rate (thalachh)

Exercise-Induced Angina (exng)

ST Depression (oldpeak)

Slope (slp)

Number of Major Vessels (caa)

Thalassemia (thall)

Output (1 = heart attack risk, 0 = no risk)

These features help determine the presence or likelihood of cardiovascular disease.

🔍 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values

Encoded categorical variables

Scaled numerical features

Removed inconsistencies and outliers

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized distributions, correlations, and key patterns

Identified important predictors such as age, cholesterol, and exercise-induced angina

3️⃣ Model Development

Multiple machine learning models were trained and tested, including:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Decision Tree

KNN

Support Vector Machine

4️⃣ Model Evaluation

Models were evaluated using:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-score

Confusion Matrix

ROC–AUC Curve

The best-performing model achieved strong accuracy and balanced performance across metrics.
